# Languages

Manage available locales and translation files.

## Form highlights
- Create languages with name/code; English stays locked from edits/deletes
- Toggle RTL support and switch the default language (auto-unsets others)
- “Edit Files” action opens the translation file editor for the selected locale

## Table tools
- Searchable/sortable name and code columns
- RTL and default columns display “Yes/No” badges for quick scanning
- Only non-English locales expose edit/delete actions
