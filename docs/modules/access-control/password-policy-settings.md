# Password Policy Settings

Configure password strength, expiration, and lockout strategy in one form.

## Options
- Minimum length plus toggle switches for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Optional expiry window, history depth, and lockout thresholds (attempts + duration)
- Page seeds a default policy automatically if none exists

## Guidance
- Balance security and usability
- Prefer MFA instead of short expirations
- Review audit logs after tightening policies
