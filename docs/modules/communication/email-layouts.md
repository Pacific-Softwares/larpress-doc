# Email Layouts

Manage shared HTML scaffolds that wrap email templates.

## Form highlights
- Layout name, HTML body, and active flag are view-only
- Body must contain the `{{BODY}}` placeholder where template content is injected

## Table tools
- Boolean column shows which layout is active
- Preview action opens the rendered layout in a new tab
- Activate action deactivates all others and sets the selected layout live
- Layouts are system-managed—no create/edit/delete actions
